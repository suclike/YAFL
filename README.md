Yet Another Flutter Login starterkit
https://gitlab.com/buzzcat/yafl

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application with working Email/Password, Facebook and Google login (straightforward to add more options such as phone).

There are a few other nice features added and ready such as localization, scoped_model and flushbar error/info messages.

## Getting Started

If you do a "Find in Path" in Android Studio on the project and look for "CHANGEME" you will get a list of places that need updating with your own details.

You should read through the following and make sure you fill in the correct details for your own firebase (https://console.firebase.google.com/):

https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase_auth
https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/google_sign_in
https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_facebook_login (https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)
